# PHYSICS

Every wheel has its own axis, making it possible to apply forces to each wheel. It is also possible to have different types of traction depending on the axisâ€™ vehicle.

The movement force is applied to the car while the wheels guide the movement of the vehicle.

Collision animations from characters will be made with kinematics.

It is not possible to **drive** on walls, but it is possible to steer the vehicle while going on walls, making the vehicle fall on the floor through physics

**DASH IGNORES PHYSICS**

## Movement physics

Try to have realistic movement physics

## Collision and pushing physics

Try to exaggerate physics on collision and pushes

Map collision will be mostly a plane

Default bullets will only damage vehicles and will **not** push other vehicles  
Impulse bullets will **not** damage (to be defined) vehicles but will push other vehicles

Try to not rely on Unity physics system
