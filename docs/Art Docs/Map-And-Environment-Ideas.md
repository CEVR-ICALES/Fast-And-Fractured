# **MAP & ENVIRONMENT IDEAS**

## **(Important) Concepts Used in This Document:**

* **TERRAIN:** Everything modeled in the world, including both the playable area (map) and the non-playable area (decoration).  
* **MAP:** Everything WITHIN the traversable boundaries, meaning the entire playable area where players can move.  
* **DECORATIONS:** Everything OUTSIDE the traversable boundaries. These are primarily decorative elements designed to enhance player immersion within the playable area (map).

* **Shape of the TERRAIN:**  
  Oval (general structure similar to "Moo Moo Meadows" from Mario Kart).  
    
* **Size of the TERRAIN:**  
  Approx. 840m x 740m (Keep in mind that the vast majority consists of non-playable decorative areas, designed to be visible from the center, which is the playable area).  
    
* **Size of the MAP:**  
  Approx. 240m x 200m (We can adjust this as needed during development).

* **Shrinking Safe Zone (Sandstorm):**  
  Works similarly to Fortnite’s storm.

## **NON-PLAYABLE AREA STRUCTURE (Decorations):**

This area defines the boundaries between where players can and cannot be (going outside results in elimination).

Since the map is set in a village-like environment, the playable boundaries would include elements such as:

* **Dense forests** (vegetation typical of Spain’s climate).  
* **Rocky cliffs.**  
* **Fields with different crops** (possibly with farms?).  
* **Mountains** (e.g., Sant Pere Màrtir, the one in front of the school).  
* **Water** (for example, a river with a strong current or broken bridge(s) preventing players from crossing).

## **PLAYABLE AREA STRUCTURE (Map):**

It is divided into three main themes:

## **STRUCTURE OF THE VILLAGE/RURAL AREA:**

* Open layout with no streets or clutter, featuring scattered houses at different angles (similar to islands).  
* A **"very typical Spanish"** village style, but not overly spectacular (best references: **Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Lleida, inland Valencia**).  
* Large plazas connected to each other, featuring markets, bar terraces, and fountains—creating a sense of openness while maintaining the village feel.  
* **"Building-Structures"** that instantly eliminate players upon entry (**bingo hall, hospital, retirement home, etc.**).  
* Awnings, balconies, and elevated structures for atmosphere, without blocking paths.  
* Frequent but avoidable traps (**wells, cemeteries, fragile floors, explosive elements, etc.**).

## **STRUCTURE OF THE INTERMEDIATE/MIXED AREA:**

* More open and with fewer obstacles to encourage combat and chases.  
* A significantly higher number of **run-down or abandoned structures**.  
* **More elevation changes** in the terrain.  
* Ideal for **large-scale battles and quick maneuvers**.  
* Features elements from both adjacent areas, acting as a transition zone.  
* Possible **interactive elements** (**overturned market stalls, abandoned cars, makeshift structures**).  
* **Ramps, unstable platforms, and dynamic structures**.  
* Possible idea: **the train (PUTA RENFE**).

  ## **SOLUTIONS TO AVOID NARROW STREETS IN THE VILLAGE AREA AND MAKE IT MORE SPACIOUS**

1. **Open spaces with scattered layout**

   * Instead of arranging houses like in a real village (aligned in streets), we can distribute them more chaotically, with wide gaps between them.  
   * Houses can be rotated at different angles or placed in irregular groups, avoiding straight lines.  
2. **Partial or ruined structures**

   * Some houses can be half-built or collapsed, leaving large open spaces.  
   * Fallen walls, collapsed roofs, or incomplete structures can create a village-like aesthetic without boxing in players.  
3. **Floating or elevated decorative elements**

   * We can add market awnings, streetlights, or hanging banners to create a village feel without blocking movement.  
   * Some houses could be elevated on pillars, allowing players to pass underneath without forming narrow corridors.  
4. **Large interconnected plazas**

   * Instead of streets, the village can consist of several large plazas linked together.  
   * Each plaza can have its own theme and specific traps.  
5. **Scattered houses as standalone obstacles in a rural setting**

   * Houses can be surrounded by open terrain and dirt paths instead of forming a dense block of buildings.  
   * This would make the area feel more like a dispersed village rather than a compact town.

  ## **FUN IDEAS / ADDING DYNAMISM TO THE MAP:**

  #### **PROPS:**

* Park benches or bar chairs that break when run over. (light props)  
* Vertical store awnings that players can pass through like a curtain (but slow them down slightly).  
* Horizontal store awnings (or bar umbrellas) that players can bounce off if they drive over them (reference: Fortnite).  
* Garbage containers that can roll and temporarily block paths. (medium props)  
* Cement bags in the construction zone that, when shot, release a dust cloud blocking visibility (like a smoke grenade).  
* A fountain in the plaza that, if a car falls into it, launches the player into the air like a geyser, sending them back to the track with a random spin.  
* Fake wells in the plaza: They look like normal wells or manholes, but when stepped on, they collapse, causing the player to fall (either as a temporary TP or permanently eliminating them).  
* Unstable scaffolding: If a player crashes into a poorly placed scaffolding pillar, it wobbles and can fall onto nearby players.  
* Fallen construction cables/electric hazards: If touched, they electrocute the player, causing their car to move erratically for 2 seconds (e.g., reversing left and right controls).  
* Paint buckets in the construction zone: 2 possible effects:  
  1. If hit, they spill and create a slippery area of a random color.  
  2. If hit, they cover the player's screen for a few seconds (reference: Blooper MK).

  #### **"Deaf Grandpa's Radio":**

Somewhere on the map, there's an old radio. If a player crashes into it, it starts blasting old-town music (jotas, pasodobles, radio teletaxi, etc.) at full volume, momentarily stunning the player (reference \-\> Engineer from PVZ GW) or revealing their location to other players.

## **OTHER EXTRA ELEMENTS:**

* Signs with phrases like "Construction sites are for watching, not touching" or "Warning: Elders behind the wheel."  
* Crosswalks with funny cane drawings on the ground.  
* Traffic lights in the construction zone that malfunction (changing incorrectly).  
* A platform in the construction zone that moves up and down with a construction elevator.  
* Conveyor belts in a construction area that automatically move players if they step on them.  
* Some ramps made of wooden planks that collapse after being used a couple of times.  
* Secret passageways inside some town houses that allow shortcuts or ambushes, possibly featuring TPs, visually indicated in some way.  
* Fruit truck (e.g., watermelons): A truck suddenly passes by and loses part of its cargo, filling the street with rolling watermelons that bounce and hit cars.  
* Traffic signs that, instead of being destroyed/pushed when hit, spin around on impact.  
* Automatic garage doors (in some town houses) that randomly open and close, allowing or blocking shortcuts.  
* Drawbridge in the construction zone: Activates after some time, blocking access and forcing players to find another route. (There must always be an alternative path to avoid trapping players.)

## **"DYNAMIC EVENTS" THAT OCCUR IN THE MAP**

*(One different event per match, making each game feel unique\!)*

### **"Mass Service" (Town Area)**

* Suddenly, the church doors swing open, and a group of elderly NPCs slowly walks out into the plaza, blocking the path.  
* If players run into them, they bounce off as if they were made of rubber (for a comedic effect).  
* After a few seconds, the elders scatter and enter nearby houses.

### **"Market Day" (Town Area)**

* More market stalls than usual appear, taking up extra space.  
* Some stalls may suddenly collapse, spilling crates onto the road.  
* Scattered items (like bananas in MK) can make vehicles skid.

### **"Construction Explosion" (Construction Area)**

* At a certain moment, a building under construction partially collapses (or explodes), sending debris across the map.  
* The falling rubble dynamically changes the track, blocking some paths while opening new ones.

### **Train Idea for the Map**

As in many towns (at least in Catalonia), there's often a train track running through the area, usually with little protection around it (unlike in cities).

### **How It Works**

* In the central area of the map, there is a train track (1 or 2 rails). The track could be straight or slightly curved to allow players to anticipate its path.  
* There are small bridges or elevated crossings that let players safely cross the tracks.  
* If a player is hit by the train—even by just 1mm—they are immediately eliminated. (Reference: *Jewel Junction* from *PVZ Garden Warfare*)  
* The train passes randomly within certain time intervals (e.g., every 30-45 seconds).  
* The train moves fast enough that players don't have time to dodge it at the last second.  
* Warning lights and train sounds will alert players a few seconds before the train arrives.

### **Possible Variations / Additional Ideas**

* **Double Train:** Sometimes, a second train can appear traveling in the opposite direction, catching players off guard who thought they were safe, potentially covering both tracks (if there are 2 rails).  
* **Freight Trains:** Some trains may carry containers with cargo, which could be either negative (dealing damage or pushing players) or positive (e.g., power-ups).  
* **Suction Effect:** The train could generate a small gust of wind that slightly pushes nearby players, destabilizing them.
